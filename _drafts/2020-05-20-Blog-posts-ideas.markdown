Statistics:
- GLM, canonical link functions, with many examples
- stratification
- Fieller test
- Go through basic probability/stats
- Basic modeling
  - case studies with kaggle
- The idea of factors/hierarchy, e.g. ANOVA?
 
CS 231n:
  - Linear methods: LDA (and relationship with ANOVA)
  - retry all algorithms using pre-trained embeddings, e.g. ImageNet
  - Thoughts:
    - Does image gradient help?
      - e.g. image gradient effectively enlarges training set for free?
  - Blurbs:
    - Subgradient method
    - KL divergence (entropy gained from prior to posterior?)

Machine learning:
- Autoencoders, VAE
- Some justification of embeddings based method and their linearity
  - [Representation Learning: A Review and New Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.5538.pdf) is a very very good read, on what "good" embeddings should look like
- Details of boosting/bagging/decision tree/gbdt etc
- Isolation forest in anomaly detection
- Linear programming; simplex method
- Restricted Boltzman machine

Misc:
- Compressed sensing
- Simplex algorithm
- Optimization techniques
