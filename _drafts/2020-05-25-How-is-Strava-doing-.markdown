I picked up running again during shelter in place, and I've been a big fan of [Strava](https://www.strava.com) recently. Their interface is slick, training logs track my runs nicely, segments is a great concept, and leaderboard is a pretty good motivator for me.

That changed recently - [a lot of these features are gone for free users](https://www.strava.com/subscription/from-our-founders) - which makes me wonder how Strava is doing. I didn't know that they are around for [11 years](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/strava) already! Mark Slavonia had [two](http://markslavonia.com/stravagrowth/) [interesting](http://markslavonia.com/sampling-strava/) blog posts a few years back to gauge how Strava was growing back then. It certainly seems interesting to redo this analysis now.

## Number of users

## Revenue estimate

## Cost estimate

## How has removal of features affected them?
